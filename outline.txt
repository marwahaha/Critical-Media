# Position statement outline 

What is the state of media arts today? How do we make work that is critically engaged? From an educational standpoint what is ethical to teach?

## what are contemporary media arts
	### algorithmic
	### computational
	### networked
	### based on significant amounts of data

## what are issues with technology (and arts the rely on technology)
	### techno utopia / dystopia
	### tech determinism
	### tech will save us
	### reductionism
	### ceding of personal/social values to engineering values - platforming
	### ecological issues stemming in part from disposable nature of technology

## what are general presumptions that can be pushed against?
	### technologies/data/algorithms are neutral
	### the internet/networks will set us free (also, these are not monolithic structures)
	### information is free/ we all benefit from access
	### more data is better
	### technology will save us
		#### the sharing economy is a good thing
		#### technology can fix social issues
		#### (technology as it exists now is a wrapper to advance capitalist norms)

## How to push against?
	### literacy is a starting point, but knowing what a variable is only a beginning  
		#### understanding the history of technology implicates present uses
	### exploit vulnerabilities in design
	### expose the frameworks and structures that reinforce the status quo
	### work with people, not platforms
		#### universal access
		#### social model
	### humor - sam lavigne/jonah brucker-cohen

## Who is making that does this / what are some examples?
	### data journalism - surya mattu, mimi onuoha
	### infrastructure studies - evan roth / ingrid burrington
	### exposing algorithms - sam lavigne (training poses, stupid shit hackathon)
	### use the tools of the masters against them (google will eat itself // ubermorgen)
